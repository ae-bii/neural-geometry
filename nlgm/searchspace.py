        The weight computation is formulated as an optimal matching problem because we want to find
        the best alignment between the component manifolds of the two ProductManifold objects that

        exactly one component manifold from manifold2 in a way that minimizes the sum of the distances

        the minimum weight perfect matching in a bipartite graph, where the nodes represent the component
